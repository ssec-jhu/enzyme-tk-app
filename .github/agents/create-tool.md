# Create Tool Agent

**Trigger:** When asked to "create a new tool", "add a new algorithm", or "generate a tool scaffold".

This agent follows the architectural guidelines for tool discovery, single-source slug invariants, and module structure in the EnzymeTK project.

## 1. Tool Structure
Tools live in self-contained sub-packages under `enzyme_tk_app/app/tools/`. Auto-discovery in `tools/__init__.py` scans sub-packages at import time — no central file to edit.

To add a tool, create a folder with:

| File | Required? | Must export | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `__init__.py` | Yes | `TOOL_DEF: ToolDef` | Metadata (slug, title, desc, icon, order, libraries) |
| `modal.py` | No | `modal() → dbc.Modal` | Input form shown when "Launch →" is clicked |
| `callbacks.py` | No | *(side-effect)* | `@callback` decorators auto-register on import |
| `compute.py` | No | `run(params) → dict` | Core algorithm executed by the Celery worker |
| `results.py` | No | `results_layout(job) → html.Div` | Custom results page; falls back to raw JSON if absent |

- `TOOL_DEF` requires an `order: int` field that controls the card's position in the grid.
- Import icon constants from `enzyme_tk_app.app.components.icons` and the `ToolDef` type from `enzyme_tk_app.app.tools`.

## 2. Invariants & Slug Management
### Single-source slug & title — the rename-once invariant
- **`TOOL_DEF` in `__init__.py` is the single source of truth** for a tool's slug, title, and icon.
- In `modal.py` and `callbacks.py`, import `TOOL_DEF` from the tool's own package:
  ```python
  from enzyme_tk_app.app.tools.<tool_folder> import TOOL_DEF
  ```
- **Build all slug-dependent component IDs** with f-strings from `TOOL_DEF["slug"]`:
  - Modal ID: `f"id-modal-{TOOL_DEF['slug']}"`
  - Launch button match: `f"id-btn-launch-{TOOL_DEF['slug']}"`
  - Sub-component IDs: `f"id-btn-{TOOL_DEF['slug']}-submit"`, etc.

### Folder-name invariant
- The folder name **must** equal `slug.replace("-", "_")`. If you change the slug, rename the folder to match.

## 3. UI & Modal Delegation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the task involves creating or modifying a `modal.py` file, you **MUST** trigger the [**Modal Creation Agent**](create-modal.md) and follow its strict layout and styling rules.

### Modal dropdowns, inputs, and form controls
- All dropdowns must use `dcc.Dropdown` (from `dash`), never `dbc.Select`.
- For all form controls (Dropdowns, Inputs, Textareas, Checkboxes, RadioItems), always add the CSS class `themed-control`.

## 4. Backend & Callbacks
- Use `get_task_scheduler()` from `enzyme_tk_app.app.backend` to obtain the singleton scheduler.
- `compute.py` must export `def run(params: dict) -> dict`.
- Callback functions names should start with a verb (e.g., `update_`, `toggle_`).
- Use `raise PreventUpdate` for early-exit guard clauses.

## 5. Canonical Template
Always refer to the `timer_tool_template` folder for the canonical implementation pattern. If you need to make any deviation from this pattern, you MUST justify and ask for permission and document it in the code before implementing.
